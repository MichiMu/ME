<h2>Who is that guy?</br>

<br>Hey there,</br>

<br>I am not a good coder. Tried a few times to go with an online course but didn't have what it takes to go through with it. 
That said, I've repeated HTML about 4 times now and can "code" it 😅</br>

<br>Still, I had an apprenticeship in my past setting up servers, doing some fundamental stuff in Delphi (Pascal) and some networking stuff. 
From the Delphi part, you can guess that was more than a decade ago...</br>

But I never lost interest in the field and that's why I am now a recruiter, listening to Tech stories as they come.
